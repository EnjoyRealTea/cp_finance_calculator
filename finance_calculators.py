# This program will allow a user to access two different financial calculators: 
# An investment calculator and a home loan repayment calculator.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"""Start
    1. Ask the user which calculation they wish to do, with information given to help them choose.
    2. Show an error message if their input is invalid
    3. If 'investment' is selected:
        a) Ask the user to input the amount they are depositing.
        b) Ask the user to input the interest rate as a %.
        c) Ask the user to input the number of years they plan on investing.
        d) Ask the user to input if they want 'simple' or 'compound' interest.
        e) Calculate and output the amount of interest earned.
    4. If 'bond' is selected:
        a) Ask the user to input the present house value.
        b) Ask the user to input the interest rate.
        c) Ask the user for the number of months they wish to repay over.
        d) Calculate and output the monthly repayment amount.
